# NoPE GPT

NoPE GPT is a generative pretrained Transformer (GPT) language model with no positional embeddings (NoPE). Built using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and trained on HuggingFace's [Fineweb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb), [SmolTalk](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceTB/smoltalk), and [UltraFeedback](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/ultrafeedback_binarized) datasets, NoPE GPT can answer questions, follow instructions, summarize documents, chat, and more.

## Features

- **No positional embeddings (NoPE)**: NoPE GPT aims to be a more parsimonious model by completely removing positional embeddings from the architecture allowing the context length to vary without complex model surgery. Despite having no positional embeddings, NoPE GPT performs better at context length generalization than the best relative embeddings (ALiBi, RoPE, T5) offering good performance even when operating within 2X the trained context window.

- **Fully Open-source**: Unlike closed-source LLMs, NoPE GPT provides both the model weights *and* the source code to train, fine-tune, export, and generate text from the model using your own hardware. With the help of the open-source software community, we aim to democratize access to AI and continually improve the models.

## Recommended Pretraining Configurations

Below is a table of some recommended model pretraining configurations but feel free to experiment with settings on your own. See the `model_sizing.ipynb` notebook to estimate the memory and compute requirements for your model configuration.

| Name | Vocab. Size | Embedding Dim. | Attn. Heads | Layers | Parameters | Min. Training Tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Small | 50,257 | 1024 | 16 | 24 | 353M | 7B |
| Medium | 50,257 | 2048 | 32 | 32 | 1.7B | 34B |
| Large | 100,275 | 4096 | 64 | 32 | 6.8B | 132B |
| X-large | 100,275 | 4096 | 64 | 64 | 13B | 262B |
| XX-large | 200,017 | 8192 | 128 | 64 | 53B | 1T |
| XXX-large | 200,017 | 8192 | 128 | 128 | 105B | 2T |

We typically recommend a training `block size` (also referred to as context length) of between 1024 to 4096 for standard models and 4096 or higher for long-context applications such as conversational chat bots, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting a.k.a "reasoning" models.

**Note**: NoPE GPT can be trained using variable block sizes since the architecture does not depend on any discrete positional embeddings. This flexibility allows you to progressively extend the context window during training.

## Install Project Dependencies

Project dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) using the following command from the project root. We recommend using a virtual environment such as `venv` to keep package dependencies on your system tidy.

```
python -m venv ./.venv

source ./.venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Pretraining

When we pre-train NoPE GPT we are focused on building a foundation of language and general knowledge to use as a base for further specialized training. The training objective is to predict the next token in a sample of text. It is a self-supervised form of training because the model learns from masked inputs of unsupervised data. For the pretraining corpus we use the Fineweb dataset which consists of about 15T high-quality tokens gathered from the worldwide web. The dataset has been split into 3 subsets (10BT, 100BT, and 350BT versions) for training smaller models. If you'd like to start training right away, the default settings should work on most single-GPU systems with 12G of VRAM or more.

```
python pretrain.py
```

**Note** that it will take a while to download and pre-process the dataset the first time that the training script is run.

To customize the default "Small" architecture you can adjust the `embedding_dimensions`, `num_attention_heads`, `num_hidden_layers`, and `feed_forward_ratio` arguments of the pretraining script. 

```
python pretrain.py --embedding_dimensions=4096 --num_attention_heads=64 --num_hidden_layers=48 --feed_forward_ratio=4
```

You can also adjust the `batch_size`, `learning_rate`, and `gradient_accumulation_steps` to suite your training setup.

```
python pretrain.py --batch_size=32 --learning_rate=0.01 --gradient_accumulation_steps=128
```

For distributed training, use PyTorch's [torchrun](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/elastic/run.html) extension to launch a distributed data parallel (DDP) session. The example below is for executing the training script on a single node with 8 individual GPUs.

```
torchrun --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc-per-node=8 pretrain.py --batch_size=16 --gradient_accumulation_steps=128
```

**Note** that when training in data-parallel mode it's important that the `gradient_accumulation_steps` divides evenly into the world size for maximum performance. For example, if we have an 8 GPU cluster, we could perform 32 gradient accumulation steps in exactly 4 passes over the network.

## Instruction-tuning

Instruction-tuning is a supervised training technique focused on developing specialized objectives such as chatting, text summarization, chain-of-thought, and prompt rewriting. The overall objective is still to predict the next token but the dataset has been curated for these more specialized objectives. In addition, we introduce three new special tokens (`<|pad|>`, `<|im_start|>` and `<|im_end|>`) that demarcate padding tokens and system, user, and assistant messages for use in the ChatML format. We use the SmolTalk and UltraFeedback datasets by HuggingFace as fine-tuning corpora because they include a broad range of training objectives such as conversation, instruction following, summarization, and human preference alignment.

Unlike pre-training, fine-tuning is not as resource intensive due to training much fewer parameters. The default arguments will work for most GPUs with 12G of VRAM or more.

```
python instruction-tune.py
```

To pick which dataset subsets to train on you can specify them in a comma-separated list like in the example below.

```
python instruction-tune.py --dataset_subsets=smol-magpie-ultra,smol-summarize,ultra-feedback
```

You can also adjust the `batch_size`, `learning_rate`, and `gradient_accumulation_steps` just like we did with pre-training.

```
python instruction-tune.py --batch_size=32 --learning_rate=0.01 --gradient_accumulation_steps=32
```

To adjust the number of trainable LoRA parameters as well as the strength of the LoRA and Dropout signals you can change the `--rank`, `--alpha`, and `--dropout` arguments respectively.

```
python instruction-tune.py --rank=4 --alpha=0.8 --dropout=0.1
```

## Training Dashboard

We use [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) to capture and display pretraining events such as loss and gradient norm updates. To launch the dashboard server run the following command from the terminal.

```
tensorboard --logdir=./runs
```

Then navigate to the dashboard using your favorite web browser.

## Text Generation

After pre-training, you can generate text from the model by running the `generate.py` script from the commandline. This inference script samples tokens from the model one at a time conditioned on a prompt and any previously generated tokens, together referred to as the context window. In the example below we are choosing to only sample from the `top_k` predicted tokens that have at least `top_p` cumulative probability mass when ordered descending by predicted probability.

```
python generate.py --temperature=0.4 --top_k=500 --top_p=0.9
```

| --device | "cuda" | string | The device to run the computation on. |
| --seed | None | int | The seed for the random number generator. |

## Chatting

Once properly instruction-tuned you can use the chat script to hold back-and-forth conversations with the model. In addition, you can provide a custom system message that serves to focus activations for a particular tone or task. To start chatting, run the chat script like in the example below.

```
python chat.py
```

Since the chat script uses the same sampling technique as the `generate.py` script, you can use the same arguments to control the generation process such as `--temperature` and `top_k`.

```
python chat.py --temperature=0.8 --top_k=300
```
